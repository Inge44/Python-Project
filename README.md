# Python-Project
## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to connect Python to a MySQL database and perform basic database operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.  
It is a small learning project designed to showcase my understanding of Python’s database connectivity features and my ability to work with SQL through Python code.

The project follows good practices such as separating configuration details, using environment variables for security, and structuring code clearly for maintainability.
